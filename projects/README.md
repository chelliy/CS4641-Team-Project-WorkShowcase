# Introduction: 
One of the biggest events every year for major American sports is “the draft”: a time where athletes from college, highschool, or any others can be drafted into the major league of their respective sport. How does a manager for a sports team decide who is the best player to recruit onto their team? Usually the methodology includes a mixture of scouting, watching film, and analyzing statistics. There is a lot of data to sift through for these team managers, so surely there must be a way to make this process easier.

# Problem Definition:
It’s quite difficult to find out what will make a great player in a professional sport—and a lot of the factors that go into this are talent-based. Team managers spend a lot of time researching and scouting new players. An objective, numbers based approach can help team managers analyze potential players—which could help save them a lot of time and money.

# Method:
The goal of our project is to find the best players to recruit—which means we need a model that can predict a player’s potential performance. Therefore, we are going to use supervised learning. Specifically, we are going to use past data on sports drafts to train our model, and then we will use this model to make predictions.

In the case of basketball, the dataset we will use is from NBA Advanced Stats. It includes draft data, prior affiliations, career statistics, and anatomical data of every player in the NBA. Based on this data, we can learn about the current performance of each player—and by using this data, we can predict who is the best player to recruit onto the team.

# Potential Result:
This algorithm will figure out who is the best player to draft/recruit onto a team. Based on this data, the algorithm will assign a draft rank to each of the players. We will know if our approach is effective or not by comparing our results with this year’s real draft result. If most of the teams made the same choice as us,  we can say our approach is good.

# Conclusion:
Currently, sports team managers (for football, soccer, baseball, and others) spend a lot of time recruiting new players. This time is spent traveling to high schools or colleges and watching players play. At the end of all this, team managers must gather their data and pick the best player to recruit. This is a time-consuming process, and we can improve this process using supervised learning. This supervised learning approach will help categorize players based on their performance and skill. Team managers can use this data to help decide who to recruit. Ultimately, this project shows promise in helping save lost time and effort for sports team managers.
